# 🦾 Accessibility Glasses  
*By Team Costco Chicken Bakes – AT&T Internal Hackathon*

## 📝 Overview
**Accessibility Glasses** is an assistive technology project designed to enhance real-time awareness for individuals with visual or auditory impairments. Using a combination of computer vision and audio feedback, our glasses aim to bridge gaps in spatial and contextual understanding through seamless, wearable tech.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection and classification
- Audio-based feedback system (text-to-speech)
- Gesture or button-controlled interaction model
- Modular hardware design using Raspberry Pi and AI camera module
- Voice command or touch-triggered modes (depending on implementation)

## 💡 Use Case
Our solution is built for those who face daily challenges navigating physical spaces, whether due to partial blindness, deafblindness, or low vision. The goal is to make environments safer and more navigable through hands-free assistive intelligence.
